# RNN-based-models

This is an Autoregressive Model trained on a latent space of a Vector-Quantized (VQ) [DDSP](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/ddsp). The DDSP was trained on Audio data.<br>
The goal of training this model is to generate latent sequences of desired length to use them further to generate Audio.
The model architechture is given below:
